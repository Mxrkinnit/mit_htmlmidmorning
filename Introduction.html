<h2 style="color: mediumblue">Coding is actually easy</h2>
<p>It is a concept that you repeat over and over again. Everything you do must be enclosed in a tag. However there are
  specific elements that lack a closing tag. Your work is actually made easy by keys such as the
  tab key that auto-completes your data </p>

<h3 style="color: deeppink">This Will Blow Your Mind</h3>
<p>It was just normal day, a normal afternoon actually. Saw this guy trying to cross the highway and the not so good
happened. A lexus SUV got in the way of the guy or rather the guy got in the way of the lexus. On God you don't wanna
know what happened, but what happened left everyone agape including me,who was watching the whole incident from the
rear driver's mirror.</p>
<p>The guy ascended floated and descended in a span of a blink of an eye and it was as if the earthly powers had coded
[tihihi] the road red after being fed up by the asphalt color and yellow strip. In layman's language the guy's blood
covered at least 10 metres of the road in all directions.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before a crowd formed [I honestly do not know where these people come from coz a second ago the road
  was man-free the next minute non-motorists were crowding blocking the road creating a fuss and a traffic jam for no
good reason. I mean the guy was dead. It only required one guy to call the ambulance and that's it instead of forming
a disorderly crowd.</p>
<p style="text-emphasis: circle">I was lucky that i had already passed the scene of the accident, i wasn't caught up by the traffic jam that lasted
  for the next 2 or so hours as per the news report. God who knows if i was the one who had hit the guy! Would the crowd
  be after my blood or would they show mercy?
  <p style="color: gold">Moral of the story: THERE'S NO MORAL BYE[tihihi]</p>
